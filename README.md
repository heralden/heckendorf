# clj-roguelike

Procedurally generated roguelike dungeon crawler game implemented as a fullstack Clojure webapp.

Once I'm happy with how the game plays, I'll probably give it a nifty name and host it somewhere.

# Development

## Server

```
lein repl
clj-roguelike.web=> (-main)

Or `lein run` if you haven't been REPLightened yet.
